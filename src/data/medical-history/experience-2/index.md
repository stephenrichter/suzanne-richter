After a [Barium Swallow](https://www.healthline.com/health/barium-swallow) test at a clinic in Vancouver, I was diagnosed with an ulcer and put on ulcer medication. No change in symtpoms. In late '07, an endoscopy at Victoria General Hospital found no ulcer. I was tested for parasites and found a common one ([Blastocystis hominis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blastocystis-hominis-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351205)) that can cause people trouble. 2 rounds of [Sulfa drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine)) did not work. In January '08, after taking [Flagyl](https://www.medicinenet.com/metronidazole/article.htm), the parasite was gone. No more constant nausea, begin to feel better.
