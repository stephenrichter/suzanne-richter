In December '09, I see Dr. Waterman at the James Bay Walkin Clinic, who first brings up the topic of [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vhtcbq_iX4) (ME/CFS). We begin to discuss options, but Dr. Waterman goes on remote medical work in Northern BC. In October '20, my family doctor in White Rock for the past 12 years, Dr. Darby, goes on leave without notice and I have no access to the 60 pills of oxycodone I was receiving 4 times per year. On March 8, 2021, I am notified by email that Dr. Darby has retired, and with no referrals, I am left without any family doctor.

It is now June 2021, and I am researching and learning more about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, and am hoping to receive a diagnosis based on the [Canadaian Consensus Criteria for ME/CFS](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Consensus_Criteria#Definition). I am on a waitlist for a family doctor at [Health Care on Yates](https://www.npclinics.ca/yates/) and [James Bay Urgent and Primary Care Centre](https://www.islandhealth.ca/our-locations/hospitals-health-centre-locations/james-bay-urgent-and-primary-care-centre). I am also seeing a naturopath at [Vancouver Island Naturopathic Clinic](https://www.islandnaturopathic.com/) and am undergoing Advanced Hormone Testing (via [DUTCH test](https://dutchtest.com/)), as well as checklists for Lyme Disease and [Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrwoth](https://www.healthline.com/health/sibo#symptoms) (SIBO). I am hoping to be put on a waitlist for the [Complex Chronic Diseases Program](http://www.bcwomens.ca/our-services/specialized-services/complex-chronic-diseases-program) at BC Women's Hospital in Vancouver.
