In February '09, I am referred to [False Creek Healthcare Center](https://clearpointhealth.ca/location/vancouver-surgery-centre/) to gastroenterologist Dr. Fishman. His diagnosis is that I possibly have remaining damage from previous parasite or [Chronic Functional Dyspepsia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/functional-dyspepsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375709). He recommends finding drugs to control symtpoms. Dr. Darby fills prescription on Dr. Fishman's recommendation of [Metaclopramide](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8679-2217/metoclopramide-oral/metoclopramide-disintegrating-tablet-oral/details), but I have a reaction with muscle spasms and have to off the drug. I also try [Methotrimeprazine](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/medications/fdb8239) with little to no effect. Dr. Fishman recommends [Amitriptyline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8611/amitriptyline-oral/details) with no effects except slight insomnia. I then try [Nexium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20536/nexium-oral/details) and [Nortriptyline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-10710/nortriptyline-oral/details) with little to no effects. After a few failed attempts, in June '09 I see alternative [Integrative Medicine Naturopath](https://integrative.ca/), Dr. Ryder, as well as an allergy specialist. Results show no allergies of any kind.
