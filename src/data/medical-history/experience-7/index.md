I spend 2015-16 in Vancouver living with my parents. I get accepted to the [Rapid Access Addiciton Clinic](https://www.providencehealthcare.org/rapid-access-addiction-clinic-raac) (RAAC) at St. Paul's Hospital. They prescribe [methadone](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/what-is-methadone) to substitute the fentanyl as it is easier to wean off this way. Coming off methadone, I become bedridden and have remained that way until the present. I take oxycodone when required to get out of bed and attend family and life events. I spent 2017-2019 weaning off oxycodone when a clinic, doctor, or specialist will only see me if I am 100% off the drug, but after weaning off can barely attend medical visits and do not receive a diagnosis or solution. In 2018, I attempt [step therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_therapy), but it does not work and made things worse.
