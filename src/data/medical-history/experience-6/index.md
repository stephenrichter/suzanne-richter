After a hospital visit in early 2011, I was given a pack of [percocet](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-7277/percocet-oral/details). These helped to solve chronic pain, and Dr. Darby prescribed me small amounts of percocet to help me go to school. I also tried several antidepressants. In late 2011, the effectiveness started to wear off and started going downhill. More hospital visits for fluids as I was unable to keep down water. Chronic pain comes back.

In March '12, I went into hospital for serious pain and inability to walk. They mentioned a [Fentanyl Transdermal Patch](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6253/fentanyl-transdermal/details), and I took that recommendation back to Dr. Darby. He did not want to put me on fentanyl, so gave me long acting, slow release [Oxycodone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1025-5278/oxycodone-oral/oxycodone-oral/details) and recommended me to [Jim Pattison Chronic Pain Clinic](https://www.fraserhealth.ca/Service-Directory/Locations/Surrey/jim-pattison-outpatient-care-and-surgery-centre). I get accepted into JPPC in November '12, and find it helps people with pain due to acute injuries rather than internal chronic pain. I see a psychiatrist and pain specialist. They do not presribe opiates, but agree to send a letter to Dr. Darby supporting fentanyl patch given his diagnosis. I begin the fentanyl patch.

2013 is a fairly good year on fentanyl patch until Christmas '13 when the opioid epidemic hits. Dr. Darby can no longer prescribe opiates, but gives me enough to wean off the fentanyl patch. This is a slow process and I move back in with my parents to assist me and begin experiencing seizures and the return of symptoms.
