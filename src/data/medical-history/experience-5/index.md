After failed attempts to diagnose in Canada, I travel to Scottsdale, Arizona to undergo 3 weeks of testing at the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona). Most tests come back with nothing, but I finally receive a diagnosis of [gastroparesis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-disorders-gastroparesis). Mayo Clinic recommends controlling with diet and medication, and I try [Domperidone](https://cdhf.ca/digestive-disorders/gastroparesis/medications-for-gastroparesis/) with no effect. Symptoms worsen, no longer able to empty stomach at all, unable to exercise or walk. Bed ridden for days at a time. Also, officially diagnosed with [Endometriosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656).
