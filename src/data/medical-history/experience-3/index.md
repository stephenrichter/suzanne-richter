In February '08, symptoms come back worse and lose 5lbs quickly. In August '08, I return to endoscopy specialist for blood work, no conclusive results or diagnosis. In September '08, I try naturopath and take intense probiotics and the [BRAT diet](https://www.webmd.com/children/brat-diet), which does nothing but I lose another 5lbs. I finally get a family doctor in Victoria who says there is nothing she can do.
