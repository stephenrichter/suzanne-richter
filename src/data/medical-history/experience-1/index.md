After a trip to Costa Rica, I began experiencing symptoms of stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting after meals. In April '07, I woke up with an extremely bad flu and lost 30lbs in approximately 3 weeks. Symptoms continued to worsen (24/7 nausea). Dr. Larry Darby referred me to specialists to try and get a diagnosis of the cause.
