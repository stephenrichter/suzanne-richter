To whom it may concern,

I, Suzanne Emilie Richter (born January 24, 1989) of Victoria, BC, have written the following letter to outline my current medical situation and request urgent support from our healthcare system. Since my previous family doctor retired on March 8, 2021, I do not have a family doctor or any consistent medical care despite significant effort and advocacy, partly due to my complex medical needs. My hope is that in writing this letter, it will spotlight my diagnoses and my need for enhanced medical care and support.

**Brief History & Facts**

In 2007, after a trip to Costa Rica, I began experiencing symptoms of stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting after meals. One month later, I woke up with an extremely bad flu and lost 30lbs in approximately 3 weeks. As symptoms continued to get worse, including 24/7 nausea, the first place I went for a solution was my family doctor, who referred me to specialists to try and get a diagnosis of the cause. The first specialist diagnosed me with an ulcer and I was put on medication. The second specialist, after an endoscopy at Victoria General Hospital, told me it was not an ulcer but wanted to have me tested for parasites.

When the parasite results came back positive, I was put on Flagyl, and in early 2008 was cleared of the parasite. My constant nausea symptoms disappeared and I began feeling quite a bit better. However, a month later my symptoms returned and I started to lose weight again. Over the next 2 years, I would see multiple specialists, including naturopaths, gastroenterologists, and traditional chinese medicine practitioners. Despite trials with intense probiotics, diets, allergy tests, and symptom-controlling drugs, I was still losing weight and no drug had any effects on my underlying symptoms. No doctor was able to diagnose the core problem, and I constantly battled a medical system that would pull my parents aside to tell them I had mental health issues and an eating disorder. Ironically, this battle against the people trying to help me started weighing on my mental health and I began to develop depression.

In the Summer of 2010, with no resolution of my symptoms or diagnosis of any kind, the best available option for me was to leave Canada and undergo 3 weeks of diagnostic testing at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, at my parents' personal expense. It was on my final day at the Clinic as I was just about to leave the clinic that I received a diagnosis of Gastroparesis, partial paralysis of the stomach in which the stomach cannot empty itself. The Mayo Clinic recommended controlling this disease with diet and medication.

After the diagnosis, my symptoms continued, now including: increased to severe abdominal pain, joint pain, chronic fatigue, constant vomiting, and significant weight fluxuations. I had worked with my family doctor, Dr. Larry Darby (retired), on pain management for these symptoms through various medications and prescriptions, including several antidepressants and percocet. To my surprise, the pack of percocet actually helped alleviate some pain symptoms, and I was prescribed small amounts to help me go to school and get through the day. However, as 2011 came to a close I felt my body slowly going downhill again and began having more bad days than good, including hospital visits for fluids as I was unable to keep any water down.

In March 2012, after a hospital visit for serious pain including the inability to walk, it was recommended I look into a slow-release fentanyl patch for chronic pain. It was not until December 2012, after visiting the Jim Pattison Pain Clinic and many psychiatrists and pain specialists that I was eventually prescribed fentanyl patches to manage the pain. The patches which were effective, but caused side effects of excessive “sleep comas”, incoherence, confusion, and memory loss. Despite these side effects, I was able to live 2013 fairly independently, going to school while living in my own apartment, and even taking a vacation to Mexico with friends. And that is when the opioid epidemic hit.

After seeing some success from the fentanyl patch, I was abruptly taken off this much needed medication due to a shift in practice based on the opioid crisis in Canada and particularly Vancouver. After going off this pain medication, I could no longer concentrate at school, and had to drop out of the University of Victoria in the final semester of my degree in Physics. I lost my apartment and my independence, and had to move back in with my parents in Vancouver and now rely on them to do almost everything for me. 

I was accepted to RAC in St. Paul’s hospital in Vancouver and was prescribed methadone to substitute the fentanyl as I weaned off. After coming off the fentanyl, as well as the methadone, I also began experiencing seizures and became bedridden.

In January 2018, I moved with my family back to Victoria and contacted multiple doctor’s offices in hopes of receiving local medical care. I continued to be under the medical care of Dr. Larry Darby in White Rock. However, as I am bedridden I often could not travel to see Dr. Darby. Instead, my parents would ferry to the Lower Mainland to attend in-person and open an over-the-phone consultation with Dr. Darby. I was required four times per year to attend in-person, which was extremely difficult given travelling with my symptoms, and would then be prescribed 60 Oxycodone, enough to last me until my next in-person visit to the doctor in White Rock.

From June 2015 up until March 2021, I was prescribed approximately 60 fast acting Oxycodone to be able to manage the pain enough to attend special events such as a family member’s wedding or Christmas Day. However, as of March 8, 2021 I was notified by email that Dr. Darby retired suddenly. There was no follow up medical care plan or referral to any doctors or specialists. I currently only have an amount of 50 of oxycodone left, and usually take 2 per day to attend an event.

All attempts at finding a family doctor on the South Island have been met with being told that I must be completely off Oxycodone before even beginning to discuss care plan ideas and possible pain management alternatives with the doctor. Following this directive is plausible; however, will reintroduce full-time symptoms, including being bedridden again and unable to attend any doctor appointments. I am currently on a waitlist at Health Care on Yates as well as the James Bay Urgent and Primary Care Centre.

Of note, I have no particular attachment to Oxycodone, it is just currently the only thing I have found so far that makes any difference. As it allows me to manage my pain for 4-6 hours to participate in family activities and events. I am open and willing to try other methods of pain management. Some methods that I have tried to date without success include cannabis, kratom, and several other low-dose pain management drugs.

**My Current Situation**

In December 2019, I saw Dr. Waterman at the James Bay Walk-in Clinic. It was Dr. Waterman who first brought up the topic of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a disease I had not heard of. As of now, I am trying to get a diagnosis for ME/CFS as outlined by the diagnostic checklist from Canadian Consensus Criteria for ME/CFS.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) is a disabling and complex illness, and about 90% of people with this disease have not been diagnosed. This is mostly due to the fact that researchers have not yet found out what causes ME, and there are no specific lab tests to diagnose ME directly. There is currently no cure for ME, although some symptoms can be treated or managed. The fact there is no cure, as well as my physical medical ailments have of course also taken a significant toll on my mental health, and for the past 11 years I have battled depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.

Ultimately, my medical needs combined cause me to feel confined and tortured daily. I am trapped in a dysfunctional body and have lost all quality of life. It feels like I’m drowning and that when I take medication like oxycodone and can attend a family function that I get a gasp of air but once that wears off I am sucked back under water. I fear that without consistent or ongoing medical care, I will no longer get those gasps of air and my disease will become all consuming.

I know my life can amount to more than being a semi-conscious person who can do nothing more than watch television. Being sick is not who I am, it's just something that happened to me, and it doesn’t just affect me, it affects everyone around me. When someone gets sick, you feel sorry for them. when someone gets sick and stays sick for years, it gets tiring to hear about. I get tired of talking about it. When you are severely ill for such a long time you lose contact with reality. It’s impossible to keep proper friendships because you have nothing to give from your side of the relationship. It is incredibly isolating and lonely. People who have experienced lockdown and/or COVID-19 can get a small feeling for what it is like.

In addition, when you are this sick, your mind doesn’t work properly, because you can't think properly. It’s next to impossible to figure out a way to get yourself out of this situation. So with the help of my family I write this letter asking for your help with this situation.

I am not looking for much, all I want is the chance to have a little bit of purpose in my life. Currently, other than for the sake of my family, I have no reason to even be alive. I want to be a productive citizen. I don’t want to be a burden on my family and my government. Even if all I can do is volunteer a little bit and help people in my community, that would be enough. I am willing to try anything. I will try experimental treatments. I will try any new idea that I have not tried yet that is scientifically legitimate. I will do anything to be able to have even a little bit of my life back. If anyone has any ideas, I will be forever grateful.

**My Request**

Ultimately, as a British Columbian and Canadian, I believe that I should be able to receive sufficient medical care and right now I feel as though I am falling through the cracks.

As such, I’m requesting support for medical care, including a family doctor, and I am open and willing to try any available solutions for my underlying medical issues and for pain management. If you or anyone you know can help in any way, or require additional information regarding my personal or medical history, please don’t hesitate to contact my family trust at suzannerichter@gmail.com.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and consider my medical circumstances. I look forward to your response and discussing any options which may be available to me.

Sincerely,
